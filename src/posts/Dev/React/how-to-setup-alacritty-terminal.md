---

_After recommendations from you guys, I've swapped out Alacritty for [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html)!
Everything is the same except the Alacritty config file, you can swap it out with this [~/.wezterm.lua](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files/blob/main/.wezterm.lua) file and everything should look and work very similar to Alacritty!_

Alacritty is an awesome, minimal and fast terminal setup that has worked great for me as an alternative to iTerm2.
Let's set it up!

**You can find my dotfiles [here](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files)**

## Open The Terminal App

Open the default terminal app on macOs.

This setup is specifically for zsh (default) so make sure you are using that.

You can check by doing:

```bash
echo $0
```

You can change to zsh if you have it installed by doing:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

## Install homebrew

Run the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If necessary, when prompted, enter your password here and press enter.
If you haven't installed the XCode Command Line Tools, when prompted, press enter and homebrew will install this as well.

## Add To Path (Only Apple Silicon Macbooks)

After installing, add it to the path. This step shouldn't be necessary on Intel macs.

Run the following command to add the necessary line to `~/.zprofile`:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
```

Now source `~/.zprofile` by doing:

```bash
source ~/.zprofile
```

## Install Alacritty

Now you can install alacritty:

```bash
brew install --cask alacritty
```

## Install git

Next install git:

```bash
brew install git
```

## Install Meslo Nerd Font

Nerd Fonts are great for showing icons in the termina. I personally use _Meslo Nerd Font_, but there are others.

You can install a nerd font with homebrew. Take a look at this repo: [homebrew-cask-fonts](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts)

First do:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
```

Then you can install the nerd font you'd like

```bash
brew install font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

## Setup Alacritty Config File

Next we'll setup the `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` configuration file to configure Alacritty.

First create the necessary directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty
```

Then move into it:

```bash
cd ~/.config/alacritty
```

Now add the `alacritty.toml` file like so:

```bash
touch alacritty.toml
```

Then open it with your editor of choice. I use Neovim, but you can use whatever you prefer.

To open with Neovim do:

```bash
nvim alacritty.toml
```

You can also open with Vim:

```bash
vim alacritty.toml
```

Or TextEdit:

```bash
open -a TextEdit alacritty.toml
```

Or VSCode:

```bash
code alacritty.toml
```

## Add the configuration to alacritty.toml

See [this](https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html) for all the available options.
See [this](https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0) to learn more about the toml.

Add the following configuration to this file. You can modify this to suit your needs.

```toml
[env]
TERM = "xterm-256color"

[window]
padding.x = 10
padding.y = 10

decorations = "Buttonless"

opacity = 0.7
blur = true

option_as_alt = "Both"

[font]
normal.family = "MesloLGS Nerd Font Mono"

size = 18
```

## Install powerlevel10k theme

[Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is an awesome theme for zsh.

Install it like so:

```bash
brew install powerlevel10k
```

Then run the following:

```bash
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/share/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme" >> ~/.zshrc
```

This will add what you need to `~/.zshrc` to enable it.

Now source `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

The powerlevel10k configuration wizard should show up now.

If you want to open the wizard manually do: `p10k configure`.

Answer the prompts to make the theme look like you would like it to. For the colors of my coolnight theme to work
use either **lean** (with the 8 colors option) or **rainbow**.

## Setup the colorscheme for powerlevel10k and the terminal

Now we'll setup the colorscheme.

Navigate to `~/.config/alacritty`

```bash
cd ~/.config/alacritty
```

Then clone this [repo](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme) which has a bunch of different alacritty themes like so:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme themes
```

Make sure you use the command as shown above to create a `themes` directory inside of `~/.config/alacritty`.

### Add my coolnight theme to the themes folder

I've put together my own theme called coolnight, inspired by my previous iTerm2 theme.

You can add it to the themes directory with this command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files/main/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml --output ~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml
```

Now open the `alacritty.toml` file with your editor of choice. With Neovim it would be:

```bash
nvim alacritty.toml
```

Now add the following to the top of this file:

```toml
import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/coolnight.toml"
]
```

Save this file and go back to the command line.

### Fix directory background color (only for p10k rainbow style)

If you're using the rainbow version of powerlevel10k, I recommend you change the directory background color from blue to black.

Open `~/.p10k.zsh` with your editor of choice. With Neovim it would be:

```bash
nvim ~/.p10k.zsh
```

And then look for `POWERLEVEL9K_DIR_BACKGROUND` and change the color from `4` to `0` like so:

```bash
typeset -g POWERLEVEL9K_DIR_BACKGROUND=0
```

## Better zsh history completion with up, down arrows

Let's improve the history completion with the up and down arrows.

Open `~/.zshrc` and add the following to the bottom of this file:

```bash
# history setup
HISTFILE=$HOME/.zhistory
SAVEHIST=1000
HISTSIZE=999
setopt share_history
setopt hist_expire_dups_first
setopt hist_ignore_dups
setopt hist_verify
```

This will allow zsh to save the history to a file and configure how it should do so.

Then go back to the command line and run:

```bash
cat -v
```

Now press on your up and down arrow keys.

Copy the codes that you get as output.

Open the `~/.zshrc` file again and add the following to the bottom of this file:

```bash
# completion using arrow keys (based on history)
bindkey '^[[A' history-search-backward
bindkey '^[[B' history-search-forward
```

Replace `^[[A` and `^[[B` with the key codes you got for up and down arrow keys if they are different.

## Setup zsh-autosuggestions plugin

This plugin provides some really nice auto completion functionality as you type out commands.

Install it like so:

```bash
brew install zsh-autosuggestions
```

Then run the following:

```bash
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc
```

This will add what you need to `~/.zshrc`.

Now source it:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can use the plugin! When you get a suggestion and want to use it, use the **right arrow** key.

## Setup zsh-syntax-highlighting

This will provide some really nice syntax highlighting as you type out commands.

Install it like so:

```bash
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Then run:

```bash
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc
```

This adds what you need to `~/.zshrc` to enable the plugin.

Now source `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

You should be getting the syntax highlighting now!

## Install eza (better ls)

[eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza.git) is a better version of ls with lots of different options.

Install it:

```bash
brew install eza
```

Now you can start using it!

You can create an alias for it in `~/.zshrc` like so:

```bash
# ---- Eza (better ls) -----

alias ls="eza --icons=always"
```

## Install zoxide (better cd)

[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide.git) is an amazing alternative to cd.

It will remember the directories you've visited in the past and make it really easy to navigate back to them
by just typing out a portion of the name of the directory you want to visit.

Install it like so:

```bash
brew install zoxide
```

Then add the following to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
# ---- Zoxide (better cd) ----
eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"
```

If you want to keep using `cd` then create an alias in `~/.zshrc`:

```bash{4}
# ---- Zoxide (better cd) ----
eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"

alias cd="z"
```

Save and then run:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can use `z` as a much smarter replacement to `cd`.

## Setup tmux

I have a [dedicated video](https://youtu.be/U-omALWIBos?si=MubYcjsjwzTbCR4g) that goes in depth as to how I setup and use tmux.

It is very useful for managing sessions in the terminal as well as different windows and panes.

Let's install tmux:

```bash
brew install tmux
```

Then you'll want to add a config for it and it should be located in `~/.tmux.conf`.

You can automatically use mine with this command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files/main/.tmux.conf --output ~/.tmux.conf
```

Now you can start tmux by running:

```bash
tmux
```

Then install the plugins I use with it by pressing `CTRL-A` (my prefix) followed by `Shift-I`.

For the tmux theme that I'm using to work properly, you'll probably need to install a newer version of bash:

```bash
brew install bash
```

Then reload the tmux configuration by doing `CTRL-A` (my prefix) followed by `r`.

## You're Done!! ðŸš€
